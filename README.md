# TrueAutomation.IO IDE+Browser plugin is used to:
- **create automatic tests faster by just picking the element in browser**
- **creating automatic tests in cases when it's impossible to use ID or any other locator impossible to use ID or any other locator**

When you pick an element that should be used in your test, TrueAutomation.IO generates a unique footprint of this element - a 'smart locator' by which the element will still be automatically found during further test runs, even in cases when the page has changed dramatically.  This allows you to:
- **save time on finding proper locators**
- **save time on tests maintenance**
